# Justin Learns Type Script
## Getting Started
### Setting Up Git 
1. Install Homebrew if you don't already have item
  ```
  /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
  ```
2. Install Git
  ```
  brew install git
  ```
3. Create a GitHub account if you don't already have one github.com
4. Setup SSH Keys https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account
5. Clone this repo 
  ```
  git clone git@github.com:KTSCode/JustinLearnsTypeScript.git
  ```

### Choosing a text editor 
You have two choices:
1. [Vim](https://neovim.io/) 
  - This is the text editor I use so I will be able to help more with it.
  - The learning curve for VIM is pretty intense, so if you aren't already interested in learning it, it's probably not the best option
2. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
  - VSCode was created by Microsoft specifically for TypeScript
  - It's a normal GUI editor so it should be pretty easy to pick up
  - You should probably choose VSCode
